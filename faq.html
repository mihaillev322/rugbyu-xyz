<summary>How do you score points in rugby?</summary>
<p>Rugby offers five distinct scoring methods, each with different point values and strategic implications. A try, worth 5 points, occurs when a player grounds the ball in the opponent's in-goal area with downward pressure. After scoring a try, the team attempts a conversion kick worth 2 additional points, taken from a position perpendicular to where the try was scored. Penalty kicks, awarded for various opponent infractions, offer 3 points and can be taken from the penalty location. Drop goals, also worth 3 points, require a player to drop the ball and kick it as it bounces during open play, demanding precise timing and technique. Finally, penalty tries worth 7 points are awarded when referees determine that a deliberate foul prevented a certain try. Understanding these scoring methods helps players make tactical decisions about when to kick for goal versus maintaining attacking pressure for tries. According to match statistics from Major League Rugby's 2023 season, teams averaged 3.2 tries per game, with successful kicking contributing approximately 40% of total points scored.</p>

<summary>What are the basic rules for playing rugby?</summary>
<p>Rugby operates under several fundamental rules that distinguish it from other football codes. Players cannot pass the ball forward—all passes must travel backward or laterally, though players themselves can run forward with the ball. When a player is tackled, they must immediately release the ball, and the tackler must release the player and move away before competing for possession. The offside rule requires players to remain behind the ball during open play and behind the hindmost foot at breakdowns. Knock-ons, where a player drops or fumbles the ball forward, result in scrums awarded to the opposing team. High tackles, where contact occurs above the shoulder line, are penalized to protect player safety, with serious infractions resulting in yellow or red cards. Scrums restart play after minor infractions, with eight forwards from each team binding together to contest for the ball. Lineouts restart play when the ball goes out of bounds, with teams throwing the ball into a corridor where players compete to catch it. These rules create rugby's characteristic continuous flow, where possession changes frequently and teams must adapt quickly between attacking and defending phases.</p>

<summary>Which universities have strong rugby programs?</summary>
<p>Several American universities have developed nationally competitive rugby programs that consistently contend for championships and produce players for national team consideration. The University of California, Berkeley has won multiple national championships and maintains one of the country's oldest continuous rugby programs, dating back to 1882. Life University in Georgia dominates collegiate rugby with numerous national titles and has produced several USA Eagles players. Saint Mary's College in California fields perennially competitive teams in both men's and women's divisions. Other universities with strong programs include the University of Utah, University of Arizona, University of Michigan, University of Texas, University of Houston, and University of Ottawa (for Canadian players). Many of these programs offer scholarships, dedicated coaching staff, and rugby-specific strength and conditioning facilities. The Ivy League also supports rugby, with schools like Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth maintaining historic programs. According to the National Collegiate Rugby organization, over 1,300 colleges now field rugby teams, representing substantial growth from the 650 programs that existed in 2010. These university programs serve as primary development pathways for American rugby players aspiring to professional careers in Major League Rugby or international competition with the USA Eagles.</p>
