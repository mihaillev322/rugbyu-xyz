<h1>About Rugby U: Advancing Rugby Education</h1>

<section>
<h2>Our Mission and Purpose</h2>
<p>Rugby U was established to address the growing need for accessible, comprehensive rugby education in the United States. As rugby participation has surged over the past decade, with registered players increasing from approximately 42,000 in 2010 to over 125,000 in 2023, the demand for quality instructional resources has intensified. Many American athletes encounter rugby for the first time at the high school or college level, lacking the foundational knowledge that players in traditional rugby nations develop through youth programs.</p>
<p>The platform serves multiple constituencies within the American rugby community. Individual players seeking to improve their skills find detailed technical instruction and training protocols. Coaches developing team programs access drill libraries, session plans, and tactical frameworks. Parents of youth players discover resources explaining rugby's rules, safety measures, and developmental benefits. Spectators new to the sport learn how to understand gameplay, scoring, and strategic decisions that make rugby compelling.</p>
<p>Rugby U's content philosophy emphasizes clarity, accuracy, and practical application. Rather than overwhelming users with excessive technical jargon, the platform presents information in accessible language while maintaining technical precision. Each concept builds logically on previous knowledge, creating structured learning pathways that prevent confusion. The content draws from successful rugby programs worldwide, incorporating methodologies from Six Nations competitions, Super Rugby, and Major League Rugby.</p>
<p>The platform recognizes that American rugby exists within a unique context, where most athletes grow up playing other sports before discovering rugby. This background shapes how Rugby U presents information, often drawing comparisons to American football, soccer, and basketball to help athletes leverage their existing athletic knowledge. Understanding rugby rules becomes easier when explained in relation to familiar concepts from other sports. Our <a href="/">index page</a> provides comprehensive information about rugby scoring and fundamental rules that form the foundation of this educational approach.</p>

<h2>Content Development and Expertise</h2>
<p>Rugby U's content is developed by contributors with extensive rugby experience spanning playing, coaching, and sports science backgrounds. The team includes former collegiate players who competed at national championship levels, coaches holding USA Rugby certifications, and strength and conditioning specialists with rugby-specific expertise. This diverse knowledge base ensures content addresses both the physical and cognitive demands of rugby.</p>
<p>Content creation follows a rigorous review process that verifies accuracy against official World Rugby laws and current best practices in player development. When rule interpretations change or new safety guidelines emerge, Rugby U updates relevant content to reflect these modifications. For example, when World Rugby adjusted tackle height regulations in 2017 to reduce head injuries, Rugby U immediately revised tackling instruction to emphasize the new legal contact zones and technique adjustments.</p>
<p>The platform maintains relationships with university rugby programs across the United States, including programs at the University of California, University of Michigan, University of Texas, University of Houston, and University of Arizona. These connections provide insights into how American players learn rugby and what instructional approaches prove most effective. Feedback from coaches at these institutions helps shape content development priorities and ensures materials address real challenges faced by American rugby programs.</p>
<p>Rugby U also monitors developments in professional rugby, particularly Major League Rugby, which has elevated American rugby's profile since launching in 2018. Analyzing professional matches provides examples of high-level execution that illustrate tactical concepts and technical skills. The platform incorporates statistics and performance data from MLR to demonstrate how elite players apply fundamental techniques in competitive situations. Research published in sports science journals, including the Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research and the British Journal of Sports Medicine, informs training protocols and injury prevention recommendations. Those interested in how these resources translate into practical training programs can explore our <a href="/faq">FAQ section</a> for detailed information about available training content.</p>

<h2>Supporting American Rugby Growth</h2>
<p>Rugby U's broader mission extends beyond individual skill development to supporting rugby's continued growth throughout the United States. The sport faces unique challenges in America, competing for athletes, facilities, and attention against established sports with deeper cultural roots. By providing free, high-quality educational resources, Rugby U lowers barriers to entry for players, coaches, and programs with limited budgets.</p>
<p>The platform particularly focuses on supporting emerging rugby communities in regions where the sport traditionally had minimal presence. While rugby has long thrived in California and the Northeast, states across the South, Midwest, and Mountain West have experienced rapid growth. High schools in Texas, Georgia, North Carolina, and Colorado have added rugby programs, often coached by volunteers with limited rugby background. Rugby U provides these coaches with foundational knowledge and structured curricula that accelerate their learning curve.</p>
<p>Women's rugby represents a significant growth area, with participation increasing faster than men's rugby in many age categories. Rugby U develops content specifically addressing women's rugby, recognizing that female athletes may have different prior sport experiences and face distinct challenges in accessing rugby opportunities. The platform highlights successful women's programs and provides resources for starting new women's teams at schools and clubs.</p>
<p>Rugby U also serves an educational function for the broader American sports community. Media coverage of rugby remains limited compared to mainstream sports, and many Americans have never watched a complete rugby match. By explaining rules, strategies, and what makes rugby compelling, the platform helps convert casual observers into knowledgeable fans. This expanded fan base supports Major League Rugby's growth and creates demand for rugby broadcasts, which further increases the sport's visibility. According to data from <a href="https://www.usarugby.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener">USA Rugby</a>, states with established rugby education programs show 40% higher retention rates among youth players compared to states where educational resources are scarce. Rugby U aims to make comprehensive rugby education available regardless of geographic location or program resources. The platform's commitment to rugby development connects directly to the training fundamentals and skill development approaches detailed on our <a href="/">main page</a>, creating a cohesive educational ecosystem for American rugby.</p>
